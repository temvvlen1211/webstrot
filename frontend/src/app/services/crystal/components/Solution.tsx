          Richard can't sleep this night, he's thinking about what to do.
          Suddenly it is like if he is in front of the true. He was too extreme
          thinking to go living in another part of the world. It is more
          intelligent to first travel and then if he likes he will come back to
          look for an apartment and a job.
